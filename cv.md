## I have absolutely no prior experience in the field of coding or programming, which is the main reason I started the Stage 0 course, but I am always open to learn new skills especially in our time and age, in which inforamtion is key. One of my strenghts is the fact that I am a fast learner and confident in my actions. I enjoy figuring out problems by myself, but am also not too proud to ask for help or work in a team and share my knowledge.
## Skills: no programming skills yet
## Code:

```javascript
function myCode() {
    console.log('My first code!')
}
```

## No experience working in this field
## I have a degree in linguistics/translation
## English is my third language and I am quiet confident in it (C2)
