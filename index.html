    I have absolutely no prior experience in the field of coding or programming, 
    which is the main reason I started the Stage 0 course, but I am always open 
    to learn new skills especially in our time and age, in which inforamtion is key. 
    One of my strenghts is the fact that I am a fast learner and confident in my actions. 
    I enjoy figuring out problems by myself, but am also not too proud to ask for help or 
    work in a team and share my knowledge.
