    <h1>Natali Kairets</h1>
    <p>n.kairets@gmx.de</p>
    <p>I have absolutely no prior experience in the field of coding or programming, which is the main reason I started the Stage 0 course, but I am always open to learn new skills especially in our time and age, in which inforamtion is key. One of my strenghts is the fact that I am a fast learner and confident in my actions. I enjoy figuring out problems by myself, but I am also not too proud to ask for help or work in a team and share my knowledge. This message is for whoever is going to see this embarrassment of a code. You should know that I'm very sorry for it, I just couldn't figure out how to combine css to html. xD</p>
